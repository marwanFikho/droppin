## The dashboard

### Tabs and statuses
- **All**: Everything in one list.
- **Awaiting Schedule**: Packages created but not scheduled for pickup.
- **Scheduled for Pickup**: Pickup time arranged.
- **Pending**: Created and accepted, awaiting handover.
- **In Transit**: With the driver—includes assigned, picked up, and on the way.
- **Delivered**: Successfully delivered to the recipient.
- **Return to Shop**: Packages in a return flow.
- **Cancelled / Rejected**: Not proceeding forward (with sub-states like awaiting return/returned).

Each tab shows a **count badge** so you can quickly see where work is queued.

### Search and sorting
- Use the **search bar** to find a package by tracking number, recipient name, description, or status.
- Delivered packages are shown newest-first by delivery time.

---

## Creating and managing packages

### Create a package (typical fields)
- **Recipient details**: Name, phone, delivery address
- **Shipment details**: Package description, number of items, optional weight/dimensions
- **Payment**: COD amount (if applicable)
- Optional: **Shown delivery cost** override for the customer-facing total

Save to add the package to your **Awaiting Schedule** or **Pending** workflow depending on your setup.

### View details
- Open a package to see all fields, items, fees, timestamps, and history notes.

### Edit and notes
- You can update certain fields (like notes or shown delivery cost) before pickup or as allowed by policy.
- Post-pickup edits may be restricted.

### Cancel a package
- Available while the package hasn’t been delivered (and depending on current status).
- Find the package, choose **Cancel**, confirm. The package will move to a cancelled sub-state.

---

## Printing AWBs

### Print a single AWB
- From any tab (except final states), tap/click **Print AWB** on the package.
- A print dialog will open with:
  - Your shop logo and name
  - Tracking number and QR code
  - Recipient details and address
  - Item summary and totals (COD + shipping = total)
- Ensure your browser allows **pop-ups** for printing.

### Bulk print AWBs (desktop)
- Select multiple packages from the list (checkboxes).
- Choose **Bulk Print AWB** to open a single print dialog with each AWB laid out sequentially.

### Mobile printing notes
- **iOS (Safari)**: Printing uses the system print dialog and works reliably on iPhone/iPad.
- **Android (Chrome)**: Printing opens Chrome’s print/share dialog.
- If nothing appears, enable pop-ups and try again.

---

## Scheduling pickups

- For newly created shipments, use **Schedule Pickup** to select a slot (availability depends on your service plan and region).
- Confirm to move the package to **Scheduled for Pickup**.
- You can reschedule or cancel prior to pickup within policy limits.

---

## Fees, COD, and totals

- **COD Amount**: The amount to collect from the recipient upon delivery.
- **Shipping Fees**: Your account’s default shipping cost or a dynamically computed value.
- **Shown Shipping Fees**: A configurable value you may show to recipients if you choose to display a specific shipping fee.
- **Total**: COD + shipping.
- AWBs show the breakdown (Sub Total, Shipping, Total) for clarity.

---

## Status flow (simplified)

Created → Awaiting Schedule → Scheduled for Pickup → Pending → In Transit → Delivered

At various points, a package may transition to **Return to Shop**, **Cancelled**, or **Rejected** based on events.

---

## Tips and best practices

- **Confirm shop profile details** so your AWBs show the correct business name and branding.
- **Use search** to quickly locate a tracking number during busy periods.
- **Print before handover** so the driver can scan/verify quickly.
- **Check pop-up settings** if print dialogs don’t appear.
- **Re-check fees** on the AWB if you override shown delivery costs.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Print dialog doesn’t open**
  - Enable pop-ups for your domain.
  - On iOS, try Safari (system print dialog) if using an embedded browser.
- **Logo or QR not visible**
  - Ensure stable internet; refresh and print again.
- **Totals look off**
  - Verify COD, shipping fees, and shown delivery cost in the package details, then reprint.
- **Cannot cancel**
  - The current status may not allow cancellation. Contact support for assistance.

## FAQs

- **Can I reprint an AWB after pickup?**
  - Yes, you can open the package and choose **Print AWB** again as long as the page still exposes the action for that status.
- **How do I print multiple AWBs together?**
  - On desktop, use the checkboxes to select packages, then choose **Bulk Print AWB**.
- **Why do I see different shipping fees on different packages?**
  - Shipping fees may vary by destination, weight/dimensions, or your plan. A "shown shipping fee" override can also affect the displayed value.
